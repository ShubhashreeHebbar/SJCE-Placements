                    <h2>Using Information from SAS</h2>
                    <p>You may use personal information gathered from SAS only to follow up with another user about a specific posting, not to send spam/ phishing or collect personal information from someone who hasn't agreed to that.</p>
                    </br>
                    <h2>Access, Modification, and Deletion</h2>
                    <p>You can see, modify or erase your personal information by reviewing your posting or account status page. Contact <a href="privacy@SAS.in">customer support</a> to review any personal information we store that is not available on SAS.
                        There may be a charge associated with such requests but these will not exceed the amounts permitted by law. We delete personal information when we no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier. We retain personal information
                        as permitted by law to resolve disputes, enforce our policies; and prevent bad guys from coming back.</p>
                    </br>
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We use a number of mechanisms (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect the security and integrity of your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet
                        can be guaranteed to be completely secure. So while we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once any personal information
                        comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>

                        feature on SAS. Users further agree that the authenticity of, and consequences from the posting by users of any personal information of themselves or any other person, are the sole responsibility of the user. Users further agree

                    <p>We may update, upgrade, modify (partially &amp;/or fully) this policy at any time, with updates taking effect when you next post or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. If we or our corporate affiliates are involved in a merger or acquisition,
                        we may share personal information with another company, but this policy will continue to apply. Send questions about this policy to <a href="mailto:privacy@SAS.in">privacy@SAS.in</a>.</p>
